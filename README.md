# ESP32-Closed-Loop-Temperature-Controller-With-Motorized-Knob
This project is a fully self-contained temperature control system built on the ESP32. It uses a MAX6675 thermocouple for temperature feedback, a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with ULN2003 driver to physically rotate a control knob, and a local web interface for setting the target temperature.
